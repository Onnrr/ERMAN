# ERMAN
### Project description:
ERMAN is a web application that aims to help students, coordinators, instructors and Exchange office officials, through the Erasmus and Exchange process. Students will be able to submit all the required forms through the software without dealing with physical paper or e-mails that might get lost. Students will be able to track the status of their application and the exchange coordinators will manage the processes easier and will have to deal with less paper/email work. Coordinators will be able to approve courses, place students with universities using the stable matching algorithm and prepare pre-approval forms using ERMAN. Since ERMAN is a web app, it requires no downloads and one can start using it immediately. 

### Expected Erasmus and Exchange Process Post Erman
First, exchange office officials will upload the excel files to the system with student list information. Then the application will place students in universities according to their calculated scores and preferences. Later, coordinators and students will be able to track the status of the application. Course selections, form submissions, communication with coordinators and other students who applied for the same university.
